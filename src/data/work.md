I'm a Bristol based web developer, with 2 years of front-end development experience developing apps and websites.

I have recently been working at [Appeal Digital](https://appeal.digital/), a web design and development agency which provides content managed websites for clients. It has been valuable experience to work in a fast paced environment to meet project timeframes and building sites to design and functional specification.

I am now looking to move into an app development focused role, following on from my experience at Flexidb where I contributed to several React + Redux projects including implementing a [SWOT Analysis tool](https://www.minddoodle.com/features/swot-analysis/) (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) for Mind Doodle.
