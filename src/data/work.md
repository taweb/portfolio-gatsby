I'm a Bristol based web developer at [Mind Doodle](https://minddoodle.com/) and Flexidb, with 1 year of front-end development experience using React and Javascript.

Recent work has included implementing a [SWOT Analysis tool](https://www.minddoodle.com/features/swot-analysis/) (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) for Mind Doodle, an app which helps individuals and teams to collaborate and manage projects.
